NB: This project is inspired by the following paper, the authors of which I owe a debt of gratitude for providing the code and data files I used:

> Eli J. Cornblath et al. (2021). Computational modeling of tau pathology spread reveals patterns of regional vulnerability and the impact of a genetic risk factor. Science.

This endeavor simply represents an attempt to accelerate my own understanding of Connectomics.
